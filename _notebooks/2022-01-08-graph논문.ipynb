    "In applications such as social, energy, transportation, sensor, and neuronal networks, high-dimensional data naturally reside on the vertices of weighted graphs. **The emerging field of signal processing on graphs merges algebraic and spectral graph theoretic concepts with computational harmonic analysis to process such signals on graphs.** In this tutorial overview, we outline the main challenges of the area, discuss different ways to define graph spectral domains, which are the analogues to the classical frequency domain, and highlight the importance of incorporating the irregular structures of graph data domains when processing signals on graphs. We then review methods to generalize fundamental operations such as filtering, translation, modulation, dilation, and downsampling to the graph setting, and survey the localized, multiscale transforms that have been proposed to efficiently extract information from high-dimensional data on graphs. We conclude with a brief discussion of open issues and possible extensions."

    "*Graphs are generic data representation forms which are useful for describing the geometric structures of data domains in numerous applications, including social, energy, transportation, sensor, and neuronal networks.* *The weight associated with each edge in the graph often represents the similarity between the two vertices it connects.* The connectivities and edge weights are either dictated by the physics of the problem at hand or inferred from the data. For instance, the edge weight may be inversely proportional to the physical distance between nodes in the network. The data on these graphs can be visualized as a finite collection of samples, with one sample at each vertex in the graph. Collectively, we refer to these samples as a **graph signal**. An example of a graph signal is shown in Figure 1."

    "We find examples of graph signals in many different engineering and science fields. In transportation networks, we may be interested in analyzing epidemiological data describing the spread of disease, census data describing human migration patterns, or logistics data describing inventories of trade goods (e.g. gasoline or grain stocks). In brain imaging, it is now possible to non-invasively infer the anatomical connectivity of distinct functional regions of the cerebral cortex [1], and this connectivity can be represented by a weighted graph with the vertices corresponding to the functional regions of interest. Thus, noisy fMRI images can be viewed as signals on weighted graphs. *Weighted graphs are also commonly used to represent similarities between data points in statistical learning problems for applications such as machine vision [2] and automatic text classification [3].* In fact, much of the literature on graph-based data analysis techniques emanates from the statistical learning community, as graph-based methods became especially popular for the **semi-supervised learning problem** where the objective is to classify unknown data with the help of a few labelled samples (e.g., [4]–[9]). In image processing, there has been a recent spike *in graph-based filtering methods that build non-local and semi-local graphs to connect the pixels of the image based not only on their physical proximity, but also on noisy versions of the image to be processed* (e.g., [10]–[12] and references therein). Such methods are often able to better recognize and account for image edges and textures."

    "Common data processing tasks in these applications include filtering, denoising, inpainting, and compressing graph signals. How can data be processed on irregular data domains such as arbitrary graphs? What are the best ways to efficiently extract information, either statistically or visually, from this high dimensional data, for the purposes of storage, communication, and analysis? Is it possible to use operators or algorithms from the classical digital signal processing toolboxes? These are just a few of the questions that underlie the field of signal processing on graphs."

However, it is not immediately clear what it means to translate a graph signal “to the right by 3.” The change of variable technique will not work as there is no meaning to f(◦ − 3) in the graph setting. One naive option would be to simply label the vertices from 1 to N and define f(◦ − 3) := f(mod(◦ − 3, N)), **but it is not particularly useful to define a generalized translation that depends heavily on the order in which we (arbitrarily) label the vertices.** *The unavoidable fact is that weighted graphs are irregular structures that lack a shift-invariant notion of translation.*$^2$"

Section III surveys some generalized operators on signals on graphs, such as filtering, translation, modulation, and downsampling. These operators form the basis for a number of localized, multiscale transform methods, which we review in Section IV. We conclude with a brief mention of some open issues and possible extensions in Section V."

    "In classical Fourier analysis, the eigenvalues {$(2πξ)^2$}$_{ξ∈R}$ in (2) carry a specific notion of frequency: for $ξ$ close to zero (low frequencies), the associated complex exponential eigenfunctions are smooth, slowly oscillating functions, whereas for $ξ$ far from zero (high frequencies), the associated complex exponential eigenfunctions oscillate much more rapidly. In the graph setting, the graph Laplacian eigenvalues and eigenvectors provide a similar notion of frequency. For connected graphs, the Laplacian eigenvector $u_0$ associated with the eigenvalue 0 is constant and equal to $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}$ at each vertex. The graph Laplacian eigenvectors associated with low frequencies $λ_l$ vary slowly across the graph; i.e., **if two vertices are connected by an edge with a large weight, the values of the eigenvector at those locations are likely to be similar.** The eigenvectors associated with larger eigenvalues oscillate more rapidly and are more likely to have dissimilar values on vertices connected by an edge with high weight. This is demonstrated in both Figure 2, which shows different graph Laplacian eigenvectors for a random sensor network graph, and Figure 3, which shows the number $|Z_{G}(·)|$ of zero crossings of each graph Laplacian eigenvector.

We refer to such signals as kernels.** In Figures 4(a) and 4(b), one such signal, a heat kernel, is shown in both domains.

However, we can also view the classical translation operator $T_υ$ as a convolution with a delta centered at $υ$; i.e., $(T_υf)(t) = (f ∗ δυ)(t)$ in the weak sense. Thus, one way to define a generalized translation operator $T_n : R^N → R^N$ is via generalized convolution with a delta centered at vertex $n$ [41], [42]:\n",

    "A few remarks about the generalized translation (21) are in order. First, we do not usually view it as translating a signal $g$ defined in the vertex domain, but rather as **a kernelized operator** acting on a kernel $\\hat{g}(·)$ defined directly in the graph spectral domain. To translate this kernel to vertex n, the $l^{th}$ component of the kernel is multiplied by $u^{∗}_{l}(n)$, and then an inverse graph Fourier transform is applied. Second, the normalizing constant $\\sqrt{N}$ in (21) ensures that the translation operator preserves the mean of a signal; i.e., $\\sum^{N}_{i=1}(T_ng)(i) = \\sum^{N}_{i=1} g(i)$. Third, the smoothness of the kernel gˆ(·) controls the localization of $T_ng$ around the center vertex $n$; that is, the magnitude $(T_ng)(i)$ of the translated kernel at vertex $i$ decays as the distance between $i$ and $n$ increases [41]. This property can be seen in Figure 5, where we translate a heat kernel around to different locations of the Minnesota graph. Finally, unlike the classical translation operator, the generalized translation operator (21) is not generally an isometric operator $(||T_ng||_2 \\neq ||g||_2)$, due to the possible localization of the graph Laplacian eigenvectors$(µ > \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N}})$."

To mention just a few, Lafon and Lee [46] downsample based on diffusion distances and form new edge weights based on random walk transition probabilities; the greedy seed selection algorithm of Ron et al. [47] leverages an algebraic distance measure to downsample the vertices; recursive spectral bisection [48] repeatedly divides the graph into parts according to the polarity (signs) of the Fiedler vectors $u_1$ of successive subgraphs; Narang and Ortega [49] minimize the number of edges connecting two vertices in the same downsampled subset; and another generally-applicable method which yields the natural downsampling on bipartite graphs ( [36, Chapter 3.6]) is to partition $V$ into two subsets according to the polarity of the components of the graph Laplacian eigenvector $u_{N−1}$ associated with the largest eigenvalue $λ_{max}$.

    "Most of these designs are generalizations of the classical wavelet filter banks used to analyze signals on Euclidean domains. The feature that makes the classical wavelet transforms so useful is their ability to simultaneously localize signal information in both time (or space) and frequency, and thus exploit** the time-frequency resolution trade-off better than the Fourier transform**. In a similar vein, the desired property of wavelet transforms on graphs is to localize graph signal contents in both the vertex and graph spectral domains. In the classical setting, locality is measured in terms of the “spread” of the signal in time and frequency, and uncertainty principles (see [59, Sec. 2.6.2]) describe the trade-off between time and frequency resolution. Whether such a trade-off exists for graph signals remains an open question. However, some recent works have begun to define different ways to measure the “spread” of graph signals in both domains. For example, [60] defines the spatial spread of any signal $f$ around a center vertex $i$ on a graph $G$ as\n",
    "$$∆^{2}_{G,i}(f) := \\frac{1}{||f||^{2}_{2}}\\sum_{j∈V}[d_G(i, j)]^2[f(j)]^2. \\dots(28)$$\n",

The spatial spread of a graph signal can then be defined as\n",

    "*Example 3 (Diffusion operators and dilation):*\n",
    "- The heat diffusion operator $R = e^{−Ł}$ is an example of a discrete diffusion operator (see, e.g., [43] and [14, Section 2.5.5] for general discussions of discrete diffusions and [24, Section 4.1] for a formal definition and examples of symmetric diffusion semigroups). Intuitively, applying different powers $τ$ of the heat diffusion operator to a signal $f$ describes the flow of heat over the graph when the rates of flow are proportional to the edge weights encoded in $Ł$. The signal $f$ represents the initial amount of heat at each vertex, and $R^τ f = \\left(e^{−τŁ}\\right) f$ represents the amount of heat at each vertex after time $τ$ . The time variable $τ$ also provides a notion of scale. When $τ$ is small, the $entry \\left(e^{−τŁ}\\right)_{i,j}$ for two vertices that are far apart in the graph is very small, and therefore $\\left(\\left(e^{−τŁ}\\right)f\\right) (i)$ depends primarily on the values $f(j)$ for vertices $j$ close to $i$ in the graph. As $τ$ increases, $\\left(\\left(e^{−τŁ}\\right)f\\right) (i)$ also depends on the values $f(j)$ for vertices $j$ farther away from $i$ in the graph. Zhang and Hancock [11] provide a more detailed mathematical justification behind this migration from domination of the local geometric structures to domination of the global structure of the graph as $τ$ increases, as well as a nice illustration of heat diffusion on a graph in [11, Figure 1].\n",
    " Using our notations from (14) and (27), we can see that applying a power $τ$ of the heat diffusion operator to any signal $f ∈ R^N$ is equivalent to filtering the signal with a dilated heat kernel:\n",
    "$$R^τf =\\left(e^{−τŁ}\\right)f = \\hat{(D_τ g)}(Ł)f = f ∗ (D_τg),$$\n",
    "where the filter is the heat kernel $\\hat{g}(λ_l) = e^{−λ_l}$, similar to the one shown in Figure 4(b).\n",
    "- In the figure below, we consider the cerebral cortex graph described in [41], initialize a unit of energy at the vertex 100 by taking $f = δ_{100}$, allow it to diffuse through the network for different dyadic amounts of time, and measure the amount of energy that accumulates at each vertex. Applying different powers of the heat diffusion operator can be interpreted as graph spectral filtering with a dilated kernel. The original signal $f = δ_{100}$ on the cerebral cortex graph is shown in (a); the filtered signals $\\left\\{f ∗ (D_{2^{k}−1}g)\\right\\}_{k=1,2,3,4} = \\left\\{R^{2^{k}−1} f\\right\\}_{k=1,2,3,4}$ are shown in (b)-(e); and the different dilated kernels corresponding to the dyadic powers of the diffusion operator are shown in (f). Note that dyadic powers of diffusion operators of the form $\\left\\{R^{2^{k−1}}\\right\\}_{k=1,2,...}$ are of central importance to diffusion wavelets and diffusion wavelet packets [24], [44], [45], which we discuss in Section IV."

    "Next, to empirically demonstrate the ability of these graph wavelet transforms to efficiently represent piecewise smooth signals on graphs, we compute the graph wavelet coefficients of the piecewise smooth signal with a sharp discontinuity shown in Figure 7(a) on the unweighted Minnesota road graph, where the color of a node represents the value of the signal at that vertex. We use the CKWT with scales k = 1, 2, . . . , 10, and the SGWT with 5 wavelet scales, as well as a scaling kernel. The bandpass wavelet kernel, scaling kernel, and values of the scales $t_1, t_2, t_3$, and $t_4$ are all designed by the SGWT toolbox [41]. The CKWT wavelet coefficients as scales 2 and 4 are shown in Figures 7(b) and 7(c), and the SGWT scaling coefficients and wavelet coefficients at scales $t_2$ and $t_4$ are shown in Figures 7(d)-(f), respectively. **Observe that for both transforms, the high-magnitude output coefficients are concentrated mostly near the discontinuity. This implies that these graph wavelet transforms are able to localize the highpass information of the signal in the spatial domain, which the graph Fourier transform or other global transforms cannot do.**"

    "IV. For many of the generalized operators defined in Section III and the localized, multiscale transforms reviewed in Section IV, classical signal processing intuition from Euclidean spaces can be fairly directly extended to the graph setting. For example, we saw in Section II-C how the notion of frequency extends nicely to the graph setting. However, signals and transforms on graphs can also have surprising properties due to the irregularity of the data domain. Moreover, these are by no means the only conceivable ways to generalize these operators and transforms to the graph setting. Thus, quite a few challenges remain ahead. In this section, we briefly mention a few important open issues and possible extensions."

    "Because all of the signal processing methods described in this paper incorporate the graph structure in some way, construction of the underlying graph is extremely important. Yet, relatively little is known about how the construction of the graph affects properties of the localized, multiscale transforms for signals on graphs."

    "Transform operators are only useful in high-dimensional data analysis if the computational complexity of applying the operator and its adjoint scales gracefully with the size of the signal. This fact is confirmed, for example, by the prevalence of fast Fourier transforms and other efficient computational algorithms throughout the signal processing literature. Most of the transforms for signals on graphs involve computations requiring the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian or the normalized graph Laplacian. However, it is not practical to explicitly compute these eigenvectors for extremely large graphs, as the computational complexity of doing so does not scale gracefully with the size of the graph. Thus, **an important area of research is approximate computational techniques for signal processing on graphs**. Efficient numerical implementations for certain classes of graph operators have been suggested using polynomial approximations [4], [40], [41] and Krylov methods [11], but plenty of numerical issues remain open, including, e.g., a fast graph Fourier transform implementation."

    "In Euclidean data domains, there is a deep mathematical theory of approximation linking properties of classes of signals to properties of their wavelet transform coefficients (see, e.g., [65]). A major open issue in the field of signal processing on graphs is how to link structural properties of graph signals and their underlying graphs to properties (such as sparsity and localization) of the generalized operators and transform coefficients. Such a theory could inform transform designs, and help identify which transforms may be better suited to which applications. One issue at the heart of the matter is the need to better understand localization of signals in both the vertex and graph spectral domains. As discussed briefly in Section IV, even defining appropriate notions of spreads in these domains is highly non-trivial. Moreover, unlike in the classical Euclidean settings, the graph Laplacian eigenvectors are often highly non-localized, making it more difficult to precisely identify the trade-off between resolution in the vertex domain and resolution in the graph spectral domain. Agaskar and Lu [60] have begun to define such localization notions and study the resolution trade-off."
